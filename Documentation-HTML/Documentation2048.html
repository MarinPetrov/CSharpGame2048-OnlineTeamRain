        <h3>GAME 2048</h3>
        <p>Rules:</p>
        <p>2048 is played on a gray 4×4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide smoothly when a player moves them using the four arrow keys.Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4.Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided.The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move.</p>

        <p>History:</p>
        <p>2048 is a single-player puzzle game created in March 2014 by 19-year-old Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli, in which the objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.It is a type of sliding block puzzle, and is very similar to the Threes! app released a month earlier.Cirulli created the game in a single weekend as a test to see if he could program a game from scratch, describing it as a clone of Veewo Studios' app 1024 and getting the idea from Sami "Saming" Romdhana's clone 2048, and was surprised when his game received over 4 million visitors in less than a week, especially since it was just a weekend project."It was a way to pass the time", he said. The game is free to play, Cirulli having said that he was unwilling to make money from "something that [he] didn’t invent". He released a free app version of the game for iOS and Android in May 2014.</p>
